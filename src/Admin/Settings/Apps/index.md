# Apps

Solodev Apps are ways to extend the functionality of Solodev CMS to fit individual use cases. Apps themselves can create customized backend views, power a number of different frontend experiences, and even be used to power customized API integrations. No matter their purposes, however, Solodev Apps generally share the same framework and employ a number of different deployment methods dependent upon the broad use case.

Permissions are a powerful way to control access for users and groups within your Solodev environment. By assigning specific roles or adjusting existing ones, you can tailor user access and functionality across your CMS. Need to revoke access? You can easily remove permissions entirely.

To [manage permissions](/admin/settings/permissions/permission-detail/), simply click on the row for the user or group you want to review or update. This opens detailed options for viewing and adjusting their assigned roles.

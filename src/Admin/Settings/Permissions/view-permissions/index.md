View and update permissions for users and groups, controlling what areas they can access within the CMS. Whether you’re assigning specific roles or adjusting access levels, this is where you’ll fine-tune what users can see and do. Each user or group can be assigned a role like View, Stager, Editor, or Admin, giving you full flexibility over permissions for different parts of your system.

The Permissions view offers a clear and detailed layout to help you efficiently manage access for users and groups. Youâ€™ll see essential information such as the user's or group's profile picture and name, making it easy to identify them at a glance. The view also displays permission sets, which indicate the specific roles and access levels assigned. 

Additionally, you can review app permissions to understand the areas or features a user or group can access. For quick updates, an [Edit View Permissions](/admin/settings/permissions/view-permissions/) button is available, allowing you to modify roles and adjust permissions with just a few clicks.

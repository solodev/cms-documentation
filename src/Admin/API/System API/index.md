The System API page will display the Swagger-UI, which takes an existing JSON or YAML document and creates interactive documentation.

Please check the server list at the top.

Bearer Authentication (also known as token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name "bearer authentication" can be understood as "give access to the bearer of this token." The token is a cryptic string usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

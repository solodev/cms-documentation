# API

An API is a way for two or more apps to communicate with each other.

The importance of efficient and reliable APIs cannot be overstated, which is why Solodev utilizes Swagger. Swagger is a set of rules (specifications) and tooling to semantically describe APIs using a common language readable by humans and machines. This means the same documentation can be shared with your team while also being used to automate API-dependent processes, which is great for testing and debugging API problems. Any API that adheres to the Swagger specs is easy to read, iterate, and consume.

In practice, Swagger allows you to display interactive REST API documentation in which you can test and run queries through the integration with code. All commands and the information that the API takes and returns are fully described. More advanced configurations account for authorizations and roles available to individual users.

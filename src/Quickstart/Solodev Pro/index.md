3. Configure stack options. Generally speaking, no additional options need to be configured. If you are experiencing continued problems installing the software, disable "Rollback on failure" under the "Advanced" options. This will allow for further troubleshooting if necessary. Click on the **"Next"** button to continue.

4. Review stack. Review all CloudFront details and options. Ensure that the "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names" checkbox is selected as well as the "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND" checkbox. Click on the **"Submit"** button to launch your stack.

## Monitor the CloudFormation Stack Creation Process

Upon launching your CloudFormation stack, you can monitor the installation logs under the "Events" tab. The CloudFormation template will launch several stacks related to your Solodev instance, including EFS, EDS, and EC2. If you encounter any failures during this time, please visit the Common Issues page to begin troubleshooting.

!!! Note: 
Creating a stack may take up to 30 min depending on the InstanceType you have chosen. During this time AWS session may expire, however the stack will continue to build. In such case simply re-login to your AWS account.
!!!

## View CloudFormation Stack Outputs
If your stack builds successfully, you will see the green "CREATE_COMPLETE" message. Click on the primary stack and view the "Outputs" tab. You will find the IP address associated with the Solodev backend. Point your primary domain (mydomain.com) and a dedicated backend domain/subdomain (solodev.mydomain.com) to this URL.

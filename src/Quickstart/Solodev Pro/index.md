## Monitor the CloudFormation Stack Creation Process

Upon launching your CloudFormation stack, you can monitor the installation logs under the "Events" tab. The CloudFormation template will launch several stacks related to your Solodev instance, including EFS, EDS, and EC2. If you encounter any failures during this time, please visit the Common Issues page to begin troubleshooting.

<p><img src="../../images/quickstart/stack-creation.png" alt="CMS Pro Stack Creation Process" style="width: 80%;"></p>

!!! Note: 
Creating a stack may take up to 30 min depending on the InstanceType you have chosen. During this time AWS session may expire, however the stack will continue to build. In such case simply re-login to your AWS account.
!!!

## View CloudFormation Stack Outputs
If your stack builds successfully, you will see the green "CREATE_COMPLETE" message. Click on the primary stack and view the "Outputs" tab. You will find the IP address associated with the Solodev backend. Point your primary domain (mydomain.com) and a dedicated backend domain/subdomain (solodev.mydomain.com) to this URL.

<p><img src="../../images/quickstart/stack-complete.png" alt="CMS Pro Stack Create Complete" style="width: 80%;"></p> -->

## Next Steps

### Login to Solodev

Visit the IP address or the backend domain you previously configured. Log in to Solodev using the username and the password you configured on your stack.

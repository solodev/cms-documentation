# Solodev CMS for Kubernetes

Solodev also offers a fully containerized version of the Solodev CMS for Kubernetes with orchestration via AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) or Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service). Ideal for high-availability enterprise applications, Solodev CMS for Kubernetes provides a flexible, modern, scalable solution for delivering websites and applications to meet the most demanding production requirements. 

Supported services also include Amazon EKS Anywhere and Self-Managed Kubernetes. Deploy from AWS Marketplace via Helm chart or container, with nodes available in multiple pricing tiers. 

## Overview

Launch Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in a new cluster and manage your containers at any scale with Solodev. Launch your applications rapidly and across AWS Regions and Availability Zones, and move from environment to environment regardless of operating system.

Solodev Kubernetes for EKS uses a set of YAML templates to create a new EKS cluster. All YAML templates are deployed via <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html" target="blank">AWS CloudFormation</a>.

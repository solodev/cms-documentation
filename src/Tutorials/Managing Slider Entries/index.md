# Managing Slider Entries 

Sliders can live almost anywhere on your website. While their functionality can be customized based on your specific UX requirements, they all work in a similar manner. One of the most common applications for a slider is a hero banner, which typically appears at the top of a website's homepage. By using a Solodev **Homepage Hero Slider Module**, content creators can easily update and manage the various components of a hero slider, including images, text, links, and more.

# Add Permissions to Group

Solodev features a permissions management system that allows administrators to specify the ‘Actions’ and ‘Resources’ available to specific users and groups. Solodev supports granular permissions so that administrators can create a permission system as broad or as detailed as needed.

Here you will learn how to specify permissions available to a given group.

## Prerequisites
Prior to following this tutorial, users should:

- Add users to your Solodev CMS. You can learn how to do it <a href="../../../../tutorials/cms/add-users/">here</a>.
- Create a group. You can learn how to do it <a href="../../../../tutorials/cms/add-groups/">here</a>.

## Step 1 - Navigate to the Group

Click Groups under the Organization section of the Solodev Dashboard and choose the group you wish to grant specific permissions by clicking on the group name.

!!! Note:
A group or group member can be assigned one of four roles in Solodev CMS:

- **View**: Allows a member to see items and content.
- **Stager**: Enables a member to create or modify content but not publish.
- **Editor**: Gives a member the ability to view, create, edit, and publish.
- **Admin**: Provides full editing control and management of group members.

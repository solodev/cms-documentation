# Add Permissions to Group

Solodev features a permissions management system that allows administrators to specify the ‘Actions’ and ‘Resources’ available to specific users and groups. Solodev supports granular permissions so that administrators can create a permission system as broad or as detailed as needed. In this article, you will learn how to specify permissions available to a given group.

# Domain Registration and Website Setup Guide

DNS records are crucial for directing traffic to the correct servers associated with your domain. Here are two types of DNS records you might need to configure:

## DNS Records

**'A' Record (Address Record):** This record links your domain name to the IP address of the server hosting your website's files. It's necessary for visitors to access your website by entering your domain name in a web browser.

**'CNAME' Record (Canonical Name Record):** A 'CNAME' record creates an alias for your domain that points to another domain name. This is often used when setting up a load balancer to distribute web traffic across multiple servers for improved performance and reliability.

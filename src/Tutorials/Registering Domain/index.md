# Domain Registration and Website Setup Guide

## Register Your Domain with GoDaddy

GoDaddy is a well*known domain registration service that enables you to purchase and manage domain names. To start, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Visit the [GoDaddy website](https://www.godaddy.com/) and use their search function to find the domain name you want to use. Check if it's available for purchase.
**Step 2:** If the domain name is available, proceed with purchasing it through GoDaddy's interface. This process grants you ownership rights over the chosen domain name for a specified period, typically on an annual basis.

## Set Up DNS Records

DNS records are crucial for directing traffic to the correct servers associated with your domain. Here are two types of DNS records you might need to configure:

**'A' Record (Address Record):** This record links your domain name to the IP address of the server hosting your website's files. It's necessary for visitors to access your website by entering your domain name in a web browser.

**'CNAME' Record (Canonical Name Record):** A 'CNAME' record creates an alias for your domain that points to another domain name. This is often used when setting up a load balancer to distribute web traffic across multiple servers for improved performance and reliability.

## Adding and Customizing Your Site

Follow these steps to add and customize your website using a CMS (Content Management System):

**Step 1:** Access your CMS dashboard and select "Add a New Site."

**Step 2:** Complete these steps on the "Add Site" page:
 - **Name:** Enter a valid URL or your own domain.
 - **Time Zone:** Choose a time zone according to your location.
 - **CMS:** Select the preferred Content Management System.
 - **Theme:** Optionally, add a custom theme to your site.

**Step 3:** If you own a domain, choose "Add Domain" from the dropdown menu.

**Step 4:** On the "Add Domain" page, provide a valid URL, choose a provider (recommended: AWS), and click "Add."

  - For AWS setup, refer to [cloud.solodev.net](https://cloud.solodev.net/infrastructure/providers/add*aws*account*manually/).

**Step 5:** Once added, your domain will be ready for use. Return to the "Add Site" section of your CMS to complete the setup.

**Step 6:** If you're adding a theme, customize it after clicking "Add":
  - **Name:** Pick a name for your theme.
  - **Logo:** Upload a custom logo or use the default.
  - **Colors:** Choose a Primary, Secondary, and Call*to*Action Color.
  - **Advanced Dropdown:** Customize contact info and social media links.

**Step 7:** After setting up providers and customizing your site, click "Launch" and wait for your site to be built (this might take some time).

**Step 8:** Once your site is launched, obtain your nameservers and add them to your domain registrar:
  - Refer to [domain overview page](https://cloud.solodev.net/infrastructure/domains/domain*overview/) for NS records.
  - For GoDaddy users, follow the steps on [Edit my domain nameservers](https://www.godaddy.com/help/edit*my*domain*nameservers*664) page.

By following these steps, you'll successfully register a domain, configure DNS records, and set up your website using a CMS.

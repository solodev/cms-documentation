# Websites in Solodev

Solodev is a multi-site platform. You can run as many websites and apps in one place with a single login and switch between websites easily. Each website is self-contained meaning they have separate sources such as files and folders. When adding websites, each website will be installed from scratch with their own theme resources but they can share resources . There is also no FTP, hidden files, or need to log into the server.

In order to switch between different websites, simply click on "Websites" on the Tree and click on the website you'd like to customize. 

Prior to moving forward in Solodev, you must first buy a domain which you will eventually point to your Solodev deployment. Notable domain providers include <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a>, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">NameCheap.com</a>, <a href="https://www.networksolutions.com/">NetworkSolutions.com</a>, or <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/">BlueHost.com</a>.

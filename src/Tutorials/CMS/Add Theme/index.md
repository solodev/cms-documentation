# How to make a website with a theme

In Solodev, you have the option of installing a theme to any new website that you deploy. In this article, you will learn what a theme is, how to get started  with the Solodev SpaceJet theme, and how to upload a theme package to your website.

## What is a theme?

A theme is a pre-set framework of files that manages the frontend design of your website, establishing the overall appearance and general functionality. A theme typically includes things like fonts/typography, color palettes, headers and footers, and other foundational elements that govern how your website behaves. Themes often provide templates for homepage and content pages, and sometimes offer forms and other more advanced layout and features.

!!! **Note:**
While a theme provides the frontend visual “skin” for your website, it does not limit your ability to customize it with your logo, graphics, and other brand features.

# Add module

What do image galleries, blogs, calendars, and forms have in common? They store data such as images, blog entries, dates, and contact information. In Solodev, modules are leveraged to manage this data. Modules allow the user to manage any data. Modules are one of the most powerful objects in Solodev CMS; they can be as simple or complex as necessary. They can be used to power:

- Web Forms
- Contact Lists
- Employee Listings
- News or Blog Feeds
- Events Calendars
- Photo Galleries
- Landing Pages for Marketing Purposes
- And More!

There are two types of Modules:

- Calendars – a type of module that can be modified to create date-based customer facing applications. Calendars can be used to build unlimited custom web and mobile applications to manage content.
- Datatables – are database-dependent applications that can be formatted for display in various ways on several devices.

With Datatables, users can build: 

- User Interface - Build custom user interfaces to interact with your data.
- Database Schemas - Define fields, and Solodev CMS builds tables to store data.
- Categorization - Create a system of relationships and categorization for your data.
- RESTful APIs - Utilize a built-in API to expose datatable information to external publishing channels such as websites, mobile apps, intranets, and other API-enabled technologies.

Solodev supports the following Calendar Types: 

- Events – A calendar that shows events that have a specific start and end date.
- Blog - The blog is suited for article feeds, news entries, and other data sets where end dates are optional. 
- Photos – A photo calendar is great for displaying images or creating a gallery. 
- Landing Page – Create landing pages for marketing purposes. 
- Custom – a custom calendar allows users to tailor a calendar type to their needs – using some or all the functionality in the calendar mentioned above types.

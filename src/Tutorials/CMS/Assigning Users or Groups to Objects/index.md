# Assigning Users or Groups to Objects

As mentioned in the Permissions Overview, Solodev supports granular permissions that allows administrators to create a permission system – assigning users and groups to specific objects. This document will show the administrator how to assign permissions to groups globally before assigning users and groups to specific ‘Actions’ and ‘Resources’ in the Solodev CMS system. 

## Step 1 – Globally Assigning Resources and Actions to Groups

* Sign into Solodev CMS with administrator credentials.
* Click **Groups** under the **Organization** section of the dashboard.
* Select the desired group.
* Click **Manage** located below ‘**Apps the group has access to**’ to display the permissions window.
* Select the desired resources and the associated roles.
* Click **Submit**.
* Refresh the page to view the list of resources made accessible to the group.
* Add user(s) to the group.

!!!Note: 
For resources with no associated roles, view permissions will be granted to groups and their members.

# Add page

In Solodev CMS, all pages are given an ".stml" extension. STML files are HTML files that contain server side includes (SSI); which is used to generate dynamic content for the page. When you create a page in Solodev, it will automatically have the ".stml" extension but if you're creating a page with a code editor, you need to manually give it an extention of ".stml" before you upload the file on Solodev.

This article shows administrators how to add a webpage in Solodev CMS.

## Step 1 - Navigate to the website

Click **Websites** located under the Workspace section of the Solodev Dashboard and choose the website you wish to add the page to by clicking on the website name.

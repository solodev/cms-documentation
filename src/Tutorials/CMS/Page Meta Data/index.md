# Page Meta Data

In addition to the website’s meta information, Solodev users can add meta information to different pages within the site. Open any given page (.stml file) and click 
the Meta button (the information icon) and expand the Meta accordion to start adding meta data to the Meta entry form.

In addition to the website’s meta information, Solodev users can add meta information to different pages within the site. Open any given page (.stml file) and click the Meta button (the information icon) and expand the Meta accordion to start adding meta data to the Meta entry form.

## Step 1 – Changing the Meta Title 

The meta title, distinct from the headline on the page itself, is an important part of Search Engine optimization. Meta titles are seen by visitors searching the web and read by search engine robots. 

* Open the .stml page.
* Click the **Meta** button **(the information icon)** to bring up the meta window.
* Center the **Title**.
* Click **Ok**.
* Click **Publish**. 

## Step 2 – Add a Menu Name

Users that are leveraging a dynamic and programmatic menu can submit the name of the menu in this field. If the website has a long title, users can use the menu name to ensure that visitor’s search terms will point to the site’s URL.
 
* Open the .stml page.
* Click the **Meta** button **(the information icon)** to bring up the meta window.
* Expand the **Meta** accordion.
* Fill out the **Menu Name** field.
* Click **Ok**.
* Click **Publish**. 

## Step 3 – Add a Rank

The rank is used to rank the items in the programmatic menu. This does not impact SEO results. 

* Open the .stml page.
* Click the **Meta** button **(the information icon)** to bring up the meta window.
* Expand the **Meta** accordion.
* Fill out the **Rank** field.
* Click **Ok**.
* Click **Publish**. 

## Step 4 – Adding an H1 Title

The user can add an H1 title to the meta form to ensure that the list of search results matches a visitor’s key search terms. The steps for adding an H1 title are listed below: 

* Open the .stml page.
* Click the **Meta** button **(the information icon)** to bring up the meta window.
* Expand the **Meta** accordion.
* Enter the **H1 Title**.
* Click **Ok**.
* Click **Publish**. 

## Step 5 – Adding a Meta Description

Search engines help visitors distinguish between results by adding about the individual pages next to their URLs. Some search engines allow the developer to specify the description that appears next to the page. Solodev recommends that the list of links matches a visitor’s key search terms. To do this, take the first couple sentences of the body copy from the web page and use it as the content for the Meta Description.

* Open the .stml page.
* Click the **Meta** button **(the information icon)** to bring up the meta window.
* Expand the **Meta** accordion.
* Fill out the **Meta Description** Field.
* Click **Ok**. 
* Click **Publish**.

## Step 6 – Meta Keywords

Meta Keywords are a specific type of meta tag that appear in the HTML code of a Web page and tell the search engines the topic of the page. Users can explicitly tell search engines exactly what their page is about by specifying a list of relevant keywords in the Meta Keywords field of the STML file. Solodev recommends using a combination of very unique and more general words to describe the contents of your page. 

However, using a greater number of words is not necessarily better. The closer Solodev users match what a prospective visitor types (with no extra words), their pages will achieve a more prominent ranking in the search results.

* Open the .stml page.
* Click the **Meta** button **(the information icon)** to bring up the meta window.
* Expand the **Meta** accordion.
* Enter the keywords in the **Meta Keywords** field.
* Click **Ok**. 
* Click **Publish**.

!!!Note: 
Don’t use keywords where they don’t make sense. It is their natural and consistent use that is rewarded. Don’t repeat keywords endlessly and meaninglessly, as it is considered spamming and results in the page being banned from search engine results.

!!!Note: 
Although all files contain meta properties, Solodev recommends adding and changing the meta properties of .stml files to improve Search Engine Optimization.

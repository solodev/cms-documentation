# Creating a Sitemap for your Website

Sitemaps are diagrams that show the hierarchy of the pages and organization of the website. They're maps that show how everything is linked together and how the users move through different sections of a website.

Just like buildings require blueprints at first, websites also need a sitemap and wireframes. Solodev recommends that users design the structure and content of their websites using a well-designed sitemap. The sitemap serves as the architectural blueprint for the website, and as a result, users should build a sitemap prior to creating their website.

## How to design a sitemap?

Designing a sitemap is technically easy: you can simply draw the plan of the sitemap on a paper or a whiteboard. There are several things you should think about before you plan your sitemap:

* Who is your main audience?
* What goes are you trying to accomplish?
* What do you want your visitors to do?

This requires brainstorming but it is incredibly useful in determining the information flow and architecture of the site. Once you draw the sitemap, it is time to get to making a list of the directories. 

Let's take the above sitemap as an example. We can write a list version of the diagram like this:

 - About Us
 - Clients
	-	Index
	- Detail
 - Contact Us
 - News
	- Index
	- Detail
 - Services
	- Design
	- Index
	- Marketing
	- Programming
	- Sales
	- Support
	- Training

This will help you think in terms of the folder structure and your website on Solodev CMS will reflect this sitemap's hierarchy. The next article will serve as a step-by-step guide for implementing a sitemap in Solodev.

Admins, or "super users," in Solodev have the power to add users and groups, assign permissions to unlock access to key CMS areas, and fine-tune what each user can do within Solodev — giving them total control over the platform!

## Add a Group

Let’s kick things off by showing you how to add a group to your CMS. It’s easy—just follow these steps:

1. Head over to Groups in the left navigation under the Organization section.

2. On the right side of the Groups view, click Add Group.

3. Give your group a name and a description, if you’d like.

4. Hit <span class="text-blue">**Submit**</span> and you’re done!.

## Assign Permissions

Now that your group is ready, it’s time to assign some permissions. Here's how:

1. Go to the newly created group.

2. Click on **Manage** and select the desired views and roles. This grants access to the selected views for users assigned to that group.

!!! Note:
In Solodev CMS, there are four main roles you can assign:
- **View:** Allows members to see items and content.
- **Stager:** Lets members create or modify content but not publish it.
- **Editor:** Grants the ability to view, create, edit, and publish content.
- **Admin:** Provides full control, including managing group members.
!!!

Now it’s time to give your group access to specific views. Here's how to do it:

1. Navigate to **Websites** in the left-hand menu.

2. Select the specific Website you want the group to access.

3. From the dropdown menu, click on **Permissions**.

4. Type the **Group** Name in the field, choose the **Role** you’d like to assign, and hit the <span class="text-orange">**orange + button**</span>.

5. Click <span class="text-blue">**Submit**</span> to save your changes.

!!!
**Pro Tip:** You can repeat these steps to assign access to any other views in the left-hand navigation for the group!

Once you’ve chosen the right role for your group, you’re all set to invite users!

## Add a User

Adding a new user is quick and easy! Just follow these simple steps:

1. Click **Users** in the left navigation under the Organization section.

<p><img src="/static/images/navigation/navigation-users.jpg" alt="Users link selected in the navigation" style="width: 10%;"></p>

2. On the right side of the Users view, click **Invite User**.

3. Enter the **email address(es)** of the user(s) you want to invite and assign them to the **group** you just created.

!!!
**Pro Tip:** Customize the invitation email message that will be sent to the user(s) being added!

4. Once everything is set, click <span class="text-blue">**Submit**</span> to send the invite.

And there you have it! With permissions assigned, your group now has access to the views and roles you’ve set up. By customizing access at this level, you’re ensuring your team has the tools they need while keeping things organized and secure. Remember, you can always adjust permissions as your team grows or your project evolves. Happy managing!

# Add an email tickler

In Solodev CMS, developers can add email ticklers to send form submissions to designated email addresses. For example, when a potential customer signs up for a free trial of your product, an email can be sent to your sales team to notify them of a possible lead.

## Prerequisites 

Before adding a tickler, users should:

* Create a website and a module
* Attach a web form to the module

* Open the desired module.
* Click **Modify** to bring up the modal window for the desired module.

* Enter a valid email address in the **Tickler Email Address** textbox.
* Click **Add**

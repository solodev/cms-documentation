# Packages Overview

The packages section shows users how to build their own custom themes/packages and import them into Solodev. Building a package allows users to create a fully functional website and deploy to any Solodev installation. Packages can be used for a base starting point on a new project, testing purposes, project deployment, and several applications. Before building packages, users should have a finalized design and a clear sitemap.

All packages are a collection of folders, template files and content that are placed in the web files folder in Solodev. Packages also contain a “config.json” file that installs themes, web pages and modules.

Packages are zip files that can be uploaded to Solodev during the first step of adding a website in Solodev CMS. With packages, users can import a fully functional website to any specified domain.

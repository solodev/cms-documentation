# Managing Folders

Folders are built in a nested tree hierarchy and serve as containers of all Solodev resources including files and folders to your website(s). Users can modify and customize folders to suit their needs. A folder can be used as a document repository for a company intranet or used to store HTML, TPL, and STML files destined for the web. This document will teach you how to create and modify a folder in Solodev.

Users will encounter the following fields when adding, updating, and modifying a folder.

* To add a folder open the directory of choice. For this example, expand **web files -> content directory**.
* Click **Add Folder**.
* In the form that appears to the right of the screen, enter the **Name**, **Title** and **Description** of the folder. Solodev recommends using the naming conventions for naming and * titling a folder listed in the description of folder properties above.

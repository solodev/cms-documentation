# Archive history

Archive History allows users to revert a file to a previous version. Solodev CMS keeps unlimited file versions so that users don’t lose previous work. 

## Versioning 

Each time a file is saved, Solodev CMS archives a new version. Solodev allows users to see which version of the file is open, when it was last modified and by whom.

* Open the file
* Click the **History** button to bring up a window with the file’s filename, version, date created, and author. 
* Review the information and click **Ok** to close the window. 

## Step 2 – Reverting Files to Previous Versions

* Click the **Compare** button associated with the desired version.

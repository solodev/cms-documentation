# Dashboard

Here is a general overview of the CMS workspace. Your workspace will remain in a format similar to the above with slight variances depending on which part you are in.

In general, there are four main sections in the CMS workspace. They consist of smaller parts. 

At the top, there is the Search option, which can be used to find CMS content.

In the dashboard, you can also find the existing websites, which are shown as cards. Each card displays a thumbnail of the website, and its name and is clickable to access the website directly.

In the Recents section, you are able to find recently updated items.

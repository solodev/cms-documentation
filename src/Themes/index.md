# Themes

Themes determine the overall look and feel of your website, including its layout, colors, fonts, and style. By selecting a theme, you can quickly and easily customize the appearance of your site to match your brand or personal preference. 

<div class="border p-4" style="height: 255px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <div style="width: 40%; float: left;">
    <p><img src="../../images/themes/micro-theme.jpg" alt="Micro Theme"></p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 50%; float: left; padding-left: 30px;">
    <h2><a href="/themes/micro">Micro Theme</a></h2>
    <p class="mt-3">Create a lightweight, one-page website in seconds that's beautiful on every screen. Think big with a one-page template with everything you need!</p>

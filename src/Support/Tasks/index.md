# Tasks

Tasks are a collaboration resource that allows you and your teams to work on projects and requirements in websites and applications. Project requirements can include content as well as objects or code. 

Tasks provide team leaders and members with the ability to enroll other team members and track hours and progress to provide more insight around a project. Each task user can create new tasks and assign it to others or receive and perform tasks.

!!!Note:
Tasks are used by developers and members of your internal team to collaborate directly in websites and apps and are not connected to Solodev support. For assistance based on your support contract, [contact us](mailto:help@solodev.com).

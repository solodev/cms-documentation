# Solodev Tasks

*Facilitate team collaboration with tasks.*

Solodev Tasks are a collaboration resource that allows developers and their teams to work on projects and requirements in their websites and applications. Project requirements can include content as well as objects or code.

 

Tasks are designed to provide a team leader or project member with the ability to enroll other team members as well as track hours and progress to provide more insight around a project. Each user in tasks has the ability to be an assigner, with the ability to create new tasks, or an assignee –  with the ability to perform tasks.

 

Note: Tasks are used by developers and members of your internal team to collaborate directly in websites and apps and are not connected to Solodev support. For assistance based on your support contract, contact us at help@solodev.com.

## Assigning tasks
Tasks are assigned to content objects and code in any website or document in Solodev. This article will discuss managing tasks in the Website workspace using a Spacejet theme.

**Prerequisites:** 
- Developers and project managers should have already created a website or installed the Spacejet theme.

- While not necessary a task can contain a description that is pulled from a page’s or object’s metadata. Solodev recommends adding a meta-description to each object.

**Step 1: Creating a new task**

To create a new task: 

- Click Websites from the Solodev Dashboard.

- Choose the desired website with the spacejet theme.

# API Tokens

Add, store, and manage API tokens associated with your account, allowing you to authenticate your connection to different apps and services.

Existing tokens are listed in the table on the API tokens dashboard. Each token is shown with specific details, including the token name, the API key, and the status. From the main dashboard, you can manage the status of your API token, reset it, or delete it.

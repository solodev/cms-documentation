# Contacts Overview 

In Solodev, users can create intranets to manage the majority of their workload from document sharing to storage. Administrators can use contacts to make the intranet accessible to the organization and manage its authoriized users. This document will show you how to assign administrators to manage intranet contacts, invite users to your intranet, set notification preferences for intranet users, and delete users from your intranet.

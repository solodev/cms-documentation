# Users

Solodev features an enterprise permissions management system that allows administrators to specify the ‘Actions’ and ‘Resources’ available to specific users and groups. Solodev supports granular permissions so that administrators can create a permission system as broad or as specific as needed.

---

## What are Users?

Users are the people who have the authorization to access and interact with Solodev’s resources. Harness the power of granular permissions by assigning users to groups based on specific criteria.  

Note: Administrators can mimic their organization’s structure by utilizing user groups to provide department access and functionality specific to their jobs. 

Administrators will encounter the following fields when modifying a user.

| Fields | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| First Name | User's first name |
| Last Name | User's last name |
| Title | User's position within the company |
| Company | Company Name |
| Timezone | User's timezone |  


Use the following actions to manage users. 



| Actions | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Modify | Edit a user's name, title, company, and timezone |
| Delete | Delete a user |
| Reset Password | Reset a user's password |
| Login as User | Allows an adiministrator to login as the user for troubleshooting purposes |
| Permissions | View a user's group and objective permissions |
| Apps | Set user permissions to objects in the Solodev dashboard |

# Permissions

## Introduction

Solodev recommends using Groups to manage user permissions. Groups should reflect an administratorâ€™s organizational structure. Users who perform similar tasks should be assigned to groups sharing the same criteria. Solodev recommends creating groups and setting group permissions before inviting users to the Solodev CMS system. Solodev does not recommend assigning individual users to resources or setting permissions for individual users. This article will outline the process for creating a group, inviting a user to Solodev CMS, adding a user to a group, and assigning groups to specific actions and resources.

**Note:** When adding groups or users to specific actions or resources, administrators can choose from a list of pre-defined roles to define the scope of actions members of various groups can perform on resources. The roles consist of **View**, **Editor**, and **Admin**. **View** permissions allow members of the group to view the resources; **Editor** allows the users to view add and make changes to various resources; and **Admin** allows the user to create, edit, and delete resources.

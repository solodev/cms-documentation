# Permissions

Permissions are a powerful tool that allows you to manage access for users and groups. User and group permissions can range from broad-scope team access to the fine granularity of single-user access to one single element. Permission modals exist for almost all elements to help you organize and manage your organization and team(s).

You can manage existing permissions by changing group roles and removing permissions.

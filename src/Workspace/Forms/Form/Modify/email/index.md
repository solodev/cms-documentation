## Customizing Email Template

In todayâ€™s digital landscape, emails that utilize HTML tables offer a structured and visually appealing way to present information. Tables not only enhance readability but also provide an effective framework for organizing content. If you're looking to further customize your emails and create a more professional appearance, incorporating HTML tables is essential. They allow for precise layout control, ensuring your message stands out and is easy to navigate.

The form template in your module will be used in both the email you receive when someone submits a form and on your website. To enhance the appearance of your email, consider the following tips:

- Ensure your input has `type="submit"`; otherwise, the submit button will appear in your email.

- The input values will be converted to `<p>input value</p>` format when the email is generated.

- For more customization options, consider redesigning your form to incorporate tables.

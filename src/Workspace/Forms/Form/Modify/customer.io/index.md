Integrating **Customer.io** with your forms is a powerful way to streamline customer engagement and automate communication. By connecting your forms to Customer.io, you can seamlessly capture user data and trigger personalized emails, SMS, or other interactions based on their behavior. This integration helps you enhance user experiences, nurture leads, and drive conversions without extra manual effort.

## Prerequisites

- Have a [Solodev form](/workspace/forms/form/).
- Preexisting [Customer.io account](https://fly.customer.io/signup).

## Integrate Customer.io with CMS

To integrate with Customer.io, you'll need your **Site ID**, **Track API Key**, and **App API Key**. These credentials can be found in your Account Settings > [API Credentials](https://fly.customer.io/settings/api_credentials).

1. On your main navigation, under **Admin**, click on **Settings**.

3. On the Action Bar, click on **Modify**.

4. Navigate to the Customer.io accordion.

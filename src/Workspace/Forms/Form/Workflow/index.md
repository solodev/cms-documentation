# WorkFlow

A workflow is a sequence of steps or processes that are triggered when someone interacts with or submits the form. These steps outline what happens from the moment the form is filled out until the final action is completed.

By setting up a workflow on a form, you ensure that each submission is handled systematically, efficiently, and consistently, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the chances of errors or omissions

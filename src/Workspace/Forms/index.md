# Forms

Solodev developers can create a new form module that can be edited using Solodev's dynamic drag and drop graphical user interface known as Forms. 

Solodev Forms are used for two main purposes: 

- Website Forms – these are forms found on the front-end of a website, the most common being a “Contact Us” form that captures site visitors’ data and sends it to its Solodev Module. 
- Module Forms – these are forms found on the back-end of Solodev to add, edit and delete module entries for display on user-facing websites. 

To find a specific form enter it's name into the search field.

To enter and modify specific form click the form name.

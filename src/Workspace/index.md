The workspace in Solodev is your primary dashboard, and serves as the command center for building and managing websites and applications. From one central location, you can access all of the resources you need in your Solodev environment to run your content operations. 

 
This article will provide detail about each component of the workspace and how it streamlines the content management and development processes.

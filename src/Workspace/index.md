# Workspace

The workspace in Solodev is your primary dashboard, and serves as the command center for building and managing websites and applications. From one central location, you can access all of the resources you need to run your content operations.

## Menu

On the left there is a menu. There are 4 sections that you can select.

- **<a href="/workspace/websites">Websites</a>**

The Websites tab allows to switch between multiple websites with a single click.

- **<a href="/workspace/modules">Modules</a>**

Modules in Solodev store data and control how that data is displayed on your website. In other words, whenever you need a slideshow, a photo gallery, calendar, blog or any kind of list, modules will help you create and customize the data.

- **<a href="/workspace/forms">Forms</a>**

Here you can create website forms. Creation is based on a dynamic drag-and-drop templating system, that allows to use little or no code.

- **<a href="/workspace/documents">Documents</a>**

This is a space where you can create folders and all kinds of files. Whether you want to store design files, images, marketing materials, you can do so with Documents.

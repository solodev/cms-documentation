# Copy

Copy the file/folder to another folder. Make sure the item you want to copy is marked.

**Step 1:** From the left tree menu and go into the Documents section under Organization.

**Step 2** Once inside the "Documents" section, locate and select the specific folder where the document you intend to work with is stored. This could be a folder related to a project, topic, or any other organizational category.

**Step 3:** Select the file you want to copy by using the check box. On your right navigation, look for the **Copy** option and click on it. This action will open up the modal on the right side of the interface.

**Step 4:** In the modal that appears, you'll be prompted to specify the destination where you want to copy the selected document. This could be another folder within the same "Documents" section or a different location altogether.

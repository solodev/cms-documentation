# Update Folder 

Folders are built in a nested tree hierarchy and serve as containers of all Solodev resources including files and folders to your website(s). Users can modify and customize folders to suit their needs. A folder can be used as a document repository for a company intranet or used to store HTML, TPL, and STML files destined for the web.

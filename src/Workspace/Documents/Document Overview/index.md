## Update Folder 

Folders are built in a nested tree hierarchy and serve as containers of all Solodev resources including files and folders to your website(s). Users can modify and customize folders to suit their needs. A folder can be used as a document repository for a company intranet or used to store HTML, TPL, and STML files destined for the web.

Authorized users can add or edit files in the File Group without accessing the web page directly. 

A file group can be used to: 

- Display a list of files of a file group and their content on the front-end of a website.
- Create an internal document repository where users can upload and share an array of file types grouped by type, category, relevance, date, etc.

A/B Testing is the most essential tool marketers can use to target visitors by testing their responses to varying content. Experiments allows users to test different iterations of content on different pages and track the iterations receiving the most conversions and engagement. It gives an opportunity to experiment with different pieces of content on a page, the copy on a page, images on page, different hero iterations and sliders.

## Add Scheduler

Solodev provides the ability to schedule publication of content to a live website in advance. Users can leverage the Scheduler tool to remove and replace the content of a webpage based on a predefined schedule. For example, users can create five different variations of the web page content, upload them to Solodev Scheduler, and set the dates to replace the content along with the frequency of replacement. After setting these parameters, Solodev automates the entire process. 

Schedulers can be used for two main purposes: 

- Set specific dates and times for the publication of content. 
- Display a series of announcements on a web page at a given time.

Solodev has a unique site structure that is designed for easily building efficient, well-organized websites. After your website has been setup in Solodev, your website will be broken into two folders: web files and www.

The web files folder is the one that contains the elements that power your Solodev CMS website. It is typically structured in the manner shown below, with commonly used folders storing various website elements such as HTML and image content, datatable forms and managers, as well as navigational and layout templates for your site.

Although not required for your website to work in Solodev CMS, Solodev recommends organizing your web files folders in the manner presented below.

- Content - used to store content (HTML files, images, text files, etc.)
- Forms - used to store any datatables that power forms
- Modules - used to store any managers related to your website(s) such as calendars (Events, Blog, News, etc.)
- Templates - Used to store the various templates that make up the structural foundation for the pages.

The **www** folder should reflect your sitemap. It should contain all of the root files of your website: folders, .stml pages, assets, etc.

Generally speaking, the most important files in the www folder are your .stml files. These are your individual website files that are publicly visible and are served up in a browser as a user visits your website.

These .stml files are built with templates that use Dynamic Divs. A template is used to import common elements to a page such as the header and footer. You then use the Dynamic Divs to include unique page content such as specific text, images, and sidebars.

!!!Note:
While it is entirely up to you how to name your files, Solodev suggests that the **www** folder mirror your website's main navigation and your **web files** folder be made up of folders for content, navigation, and templates.

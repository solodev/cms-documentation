# History
View the history of your file, compare versions, and restore a previous version as the current one.

**Step 1:** From the left tree menu and go into the **Documents** section under **Organization**.

**Step 2** Once inside the **Documents** section, locate and select the specific folder where the document you intend to work with is stored. This could be a folder related to a project, topic, or any other organizational category.

**Step 3:**  Access the history of a specific file, by using the check box. Locate and click on the **History** button in the upper toolbar. This action will open a modal window on the right-hand side of the interface.

**Step 5:** Confirm your choice by clicking **Ok**. Your changes will be applied, and the entry to be reverted to the selected historical version.

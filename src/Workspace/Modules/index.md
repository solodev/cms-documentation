# Modules

The modules dashboard gives you an overview of existing modules presented as a list. Each module has details such as name, location, and members assigned to each one.

You can access all tools from the module dashboard to manage module infrastructure effectively.

To get started click on the <a href="/workspace/modules/add-module/">Add Module</a> button. If you have a module already installed, you can click on the module name to see its options and modify it.

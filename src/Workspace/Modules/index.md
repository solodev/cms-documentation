# Modules

Modules enable developers to build no code/low content management features. These features expand the capability of Solodev CMS containers and deployments  -- making it easier for developers, content-managers, and marketing executives to expand website or web application features and manage content with little or no code.

There are two types of Modules:

- Calendars – a module that can be modified to create date-based customer facing applications. Calendars can be used to build unlimited custom web and mobile applications to manage content.
- Datatables – database-dependent applications that can be formatted for display in various ways on several devices.

With Datatables, users can build: 

- User Interface - Build custom user interfaces to interact with your data.
- Database Schemas - Define fields, and Solodev CMS builds tables to store data.
- Categorization - Create a system of relationships and categorization for your data.
- RESTful APIs - Utilize a built-in API to expose datatable information to external publishing channels such as websites, mobile apps, intranets, and other API-enabled technologies.

Solodev supports the following Calendar Types: 

- News - A manager suited for press releases and news articles. You can set a start and an end date/time to display the events on your website at your convenience.
- Events – A calendar for events where you can specify the start and end date and time of your event.
- Blog - The blog module is perfect for article feeds, blog posts, and other data sets where end dates are optional. 
- Photos – A photo calendar is great for displaying photos or creating a gallery. 
- Landing Page – Create landing pages for marketing purposes. 
- File Map - It allows all files to be uploaded to one place and later designate which pages their documents should show up.
- Custom – A custom calendar allows users to tailor a calendar type to their needs – using some or all the functionality in the calendar as mentioned above types.

## Modules Dashboard

You can access all tools from the module dashboard to manage module infrastructure effectively.

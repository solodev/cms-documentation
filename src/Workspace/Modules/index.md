# Modules

Modules enable developers to build no code/low content management features. These features expand the capability of Solodev CMS containers and deployments  -- making it easier for developers, content, managers, and marketing executives to expand website or web application features and manage content with little or no code.

The modules dashboard gives you an overview of existing modules that are presented in the form of a list. Each module is shown with details such as name, location, and members.

From the module dashboard, you have access to all tools that are necessary to effectively manage module infrastructure.

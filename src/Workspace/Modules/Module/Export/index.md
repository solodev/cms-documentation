Exporting module entries is a straightforward process that allows you to back up, share, or migrate data from your modules. Whether you're moving data to another system or simply need a record of your entries, exporting ensures that all your important information is preserved and easily accessible.

## Prerequisites 

-	Have a preexisting <a href="/workspace/modules/module">module</a> with entries.

## Export Entries

1. Go to the specific module that you intend to export.

2. To export the entire table associated with the selected module, click the **"Export"** option. This action will generate a `.csv` file containing the complete table of data within the chosen module.

Category pages play a crucial role in enhancing SEO and improving the overall user experience. In Solodev CMS, developers can link category pages to modules by associating them with category collections and then connecting those collections to the module.

Before creating a category, ensure you have set up a collection or category group.

Once your category group is ready, you can begin adding and managing related categories and subcategories. This organization not only streamlines content management but also ensures efficient page structuring and better control over views.

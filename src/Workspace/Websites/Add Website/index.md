# Add Website

In Solodev, you can add a new website to your CMS with just a few basic details. You also have the option of uploading a ready-made theme package with your new site. 

!!! **Note:**
Solodev is a native multi-site platform, allowing you to run multiple websites and apps in a single license and manage it all with a single login. Each site is self-contained, but resources like files and images can be shared across sites. 
!!!

## Prerequisites 

- You need a valid URL such as *www.yourdomain<span>.<span>com*. If you do not currently own a URL, you can purchase one through a domain registrar such as [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com). 
- Once you have a URL, you need to point your domain’s DNS records to the server where your Solodev CMS is hosted on AWS. Visit your registrar’s website for instructions. 
- To locate your server’s IP address in AWS, review step 6 of the Quickstart for [Solodev CMS Professional Edition](../../../quickstart/solodev-pro/) or [Solodev CMS Enterprise Edition](../../../quickstart/solodev-enterprise/).
- To apply an optional theme package, you can start with *Solodev SpaceJet*.

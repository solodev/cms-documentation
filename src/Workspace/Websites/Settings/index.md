Here you can manage your SSL information.

**Name** | **Description** 
:--- | ---
SSL website address | This domain name establishes an HTTPS connection to your website. To add it, enter text in the text box.
Sitewide SSL (Canonical) | Mark this checkbox to force an  HTTPS connection to all pages.
SSL Certificate | SSL certificates create a foundation of trust by establishing a secure connection. To add an SSL certificate, enter text in the text box.
SSL Key | The SSL/TLS protocol uses a pair of keys – one private, one public – to authenticate, secure, and manage secure connections. These keys are a linked pair of text files created together when you create your Certificate Signing Request (CSR). SSL makes one key of the pair (the public key) known to the outside world, while the other (the private key) remains a secret only you know. To add the SSL key, enter text in the text box.
SSL Chain Certificate | There are two certificate authorities (CAs) types: root CAs and intermediate CAs. For an SSL certificate to be trusted, that certificate must have been issued by a CA that’s included in the trusted store of the connecting device. If a trusted CA didn’t issue the certificate, the connecting device (e.g., a web browser) checks to see if the certificate issuing a trusted CA issued CA. It continues checking until a trusted CA is found (at which point a trusted, secure connection will be established) or no trusted CA can be found (at which point the device will usually display an error). The list of SSL certificates, from the root certificate to the end-user certificate, represents the SSL certificate chain. To add an SSL chain certificate, enter text in the text box.

Add custom redirects to automatically forward traffic from one URL on your website to another. 

In Solodev, you can directly add or modify redirects using <a href="https://loganix.com/what-is-a-htaccess-file/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.htaccess :icon-link-external:</a> (hypertext access), a powerful yet hidden file for adding extra functionality to your website that can make it more crawlable and indexable to search engines.

!!!Tip:
Several common redirects can be used to forward traffic, including 301 permanent redirects and 302 temporary redirects. Choosing the correct redirect can enhance your SEO, so be careful which one you select.

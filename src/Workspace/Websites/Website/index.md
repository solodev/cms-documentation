## Web Files and www 

Solodev has a unique, folder-based site structure for managing and building websites. This consists of two core folders: web files and www. These folders mutually reinforce one another and help power your website's content, code, and pages.

After [adding a website](/workspace/websites/add-website) to your Solodev CMS, you can access the web files and www folder from the left-hand menu on your main website dashboard. 

### web files 
The web files folder houses the backend elements that power the structure of your website. This includes navigational and layout templates, HTML, imagery and content, [modules](/workspace/modules), [forms](/workspace/forms), and other components. From .tpl code to SCSS, you can update web files from this folder.

### www
The www folder includes all the frontend pages and files that are publicly accessible when a visitor navigates your website. The www folder is where you can [update the pages](/workspace/websites/page) on your website.

### Using web files and www 

There are several functions you can perform in web files and www at the folder and the file level:

*	[Update the folder](/workspace/websites/folder/update-folder/) properties by clicking on the folder icon or text.

*	Access the contents of either folder by clicking on the triangle drop-down icon to the left of each folder icon. 

*	Under the www folder, you can use all the same functions as web files, but also [add a page](/workspace/websites/add-page) or [update a page](/workspace/websites/page).

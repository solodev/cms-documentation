# Manage Website

Solodev has a unique, folder-based site structure for managing and building websites. 

After <a href="../../../workspace/websites/add-website/" target="_blank">adding a website</a> to your Solodev CMS, you will have access to an intuitive, left-hand menu on your main <a href="../../../workspace/websites/website-overview/" target="_blank">site dashboard</a>. The menu features two core folders that contain all the files that comprise your website:

- **web files**   
The web files folder houses the backend elements that power the 
structure of your website, including templates (.tpl files), content 
blocks, <a href="../../../workspace/modules/" target="_blank">modules</a>  , and other components.
- **www**  
The www folder includes all the frontend pages and files that are publicly accessible when a visitor navigates your website. 

You can manage the web files and www at the folder level or access the contents by clicking on the triangle drop-down icon to the left of each folder.

!!! **Note**:
While it is entirely up to you how to name your files, a best practice is to 
have your www folder mirror your website's navigation taxonomy.

## Settings

From your websiteâ€™s main dashboard, you can manage the settings from the right-hand menu.

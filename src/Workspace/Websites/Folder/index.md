By clicking on the [web files](/workspace/websites/website/#web-files) or [www](/workspace/websites/website/#www) folders, you can update folder properties and access features such as uploading documents, adding links and file groups, and setting up advanced functions like A/B testing experiments.

!!!Note:
While all the functions for the web files and www folder are the same, the www folder also includes [adding a page](/workspace/websites/add-page), which can be done in the main folder (where the index.stml file exists) or any sub-folders for your website sections.

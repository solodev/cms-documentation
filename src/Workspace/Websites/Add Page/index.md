A page is the basic building block of a website. It acts as a container for your content while providing a general structure based on your [page template](/tutorials/cms/add-page-template/) and styling.

<!-- !!!Note:
if you're creating an HTML page with a code editor, you need to manually give it an extension of ".stml" before you upload the file to your Solodev CMS.

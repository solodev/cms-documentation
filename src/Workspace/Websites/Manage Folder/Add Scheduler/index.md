# Add Scheduler

Solodev provides the ability to schedule content publication to a live website in advance. Users can leverage the Scheduler tool to remove and replace the content of a webpage based on a predefined schedule. For example, users can create five variations of the web page content, upload them to Solodev Scheduler, and set the dates to replace the content along with the replacement frequency. After setting these parameters, Solodev automates the entire process.

Schedulers can be used for two primary purposes:

- Set specific dates and times for the publication of content. 
- Display a series of announcements on a web page at a given time.

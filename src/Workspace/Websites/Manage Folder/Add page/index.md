# Add Page

A page is the basic building block of a website. It acts as a container for your content while providing a general structure based on your [page template](/tutorials/cms/add-page-template/) and styling.

## STML Files 

While a page is composed of hypertext markup and served in a browser, all pages in the Solodev CMS are given a “.stml” extension. An STML is an HTML file that contains server-side includes (SSI), which are used to generate page-generated content. STML files are processed by the server when a user accesses the related webpage.

!!!Note:
if you're creating an HTML page with a code editor, you need to manually give it an extension of ".stml" before you upload the file to your Solodev CMS.

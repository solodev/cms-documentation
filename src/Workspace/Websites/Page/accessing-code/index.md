## Accessing your code from a page

In addition to in-line editing, you can access the code to update a div or .tpl on your page.

1. Open the **www folder** in the left-hand menu and select a page to edit. Remember to click on the triangle graphic to the left of each folder to access its contents.

## Manage meta information with the Metadata panel

When updating a page using in-line editing, you can view and manage your meta information using the Metadata panel at the right side of the page preview. 

The Metadata panel provides quick access to details such as the page ID, which team member made the last update, and the page's location in your website structure. It also provides editable components for page name, description, keywords, and more.

The Metadata panel can be collapsed using the small “>” icon in the upper left of the window.

Publishing a page on the CMS makes it publicly accessible on the website. This action typically means that the page is available for users to view or interact with.

Publishing can also trigger additional processes, such as indexing for search engines or notifying subscribers.

1. To publish a page, simply click on the **"Publish"** button on the right-hand side.

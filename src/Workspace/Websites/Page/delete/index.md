Deleting a page permanently removes it from the system. This action means the page will no longer be accessible or recoverable through the CMS.

## Deleting a Page

1. Select **"Delete"** from the menu. This will open a modal on the right side of the interface.

<p><img src="/static/images/common/delete-menu.jpg" alt="Delete Menu" style="width: 15%;"></p>

2. Ensure you are deleting the correct page, as this action cannot be undone.

<!-- <p><img src="/static/images/files/delete.jpg" alt="Delete Modal" style="width: 37%;"></p> -->

3. Click <span class="text-blue">**Submit**</span>.

!!!Note:
Make sure the page you want to delete is marked before submitting.

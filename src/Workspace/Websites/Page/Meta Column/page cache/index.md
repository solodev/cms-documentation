Page cache TTL (Time To Live) is the duration a cached web page stays in memory before being refreshed or discarded. Page cache optimizes performance by reducing server load and speeding up page delivery while ensuring content stays reasonably fresh.

**You can update the Page Cache time by:**

1. Selecting any of the options from the menu.

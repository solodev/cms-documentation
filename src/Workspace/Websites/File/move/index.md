Moving a file transfers it from its current location to a new one. Unlike copying, moving does not create a duplicate; the original file is relocated to the chosen destination. This action is often used for organizing content, updating the file structure, or changing its visibility.

## Moving a File

1. Select **"Move"** from the menu. This will open a modal on the right side of the interface.

2. Choose the destination where you want to move the selected file.

<p><img src="/static/images/files/move.jpg" alt="Move Modal" style="width: 37%;"></p>

3. You can update the file name by double-clicking on the file name.

4. Click <span class="text-blue">**Submit**</span>.

!!!Note:
Make sure the item you want to move is marked before submitting.

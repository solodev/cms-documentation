Staging refers to a separate environment used for testing and previewing content or changes before they go live on the public site. It allows content editors and developers to review and make adjustments to files, pages, or features in a controlled setting without affecting the live website.

Staging environments help ensure that everything works as intended and looks correct before being published.

Deleting a file permanently removes it from the system. This action means the file will no longer be accessible or recoverable through the CMS. Deleting a file can affect any pages that were using it, so it is important to ensure that it won't disrupt the site's functionality or content.

## Deleting a File

1. Select **"Delete"** from the menu. This will open a modal on the right side of the interface.

2. Ensure you are deleting the correct file, as this action cannot be undone.

3. Click <span class="text-blue">**Submit**</span>.

!!!Note:
Make sure the item you want to delete is marked before submitting.

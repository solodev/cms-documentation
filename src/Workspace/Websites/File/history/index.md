History tracks changes made to files over time. It allows users to view previous versions, see who made changes, and when those changes occurred. This feature is useful for:

- **Version Control:** Reverting to earlier versions if recent changes are problematic.
- **Audit Trails:** Reviewing modifications and ensuring content integrity.
- **Collaboration:** Understanding how content has evolved and resolving conflicts.

History provides a way to manage and maintain content effectively, especially in collaborative environments.

Under web files, you can [update folders](/workspace/websites/folder/update-folder/) or directly access specific files to edit their code using the built-in code editor. This includes template files (.tpl), configuration files, SCSS, package.json, form assets, and other essential components for your website. 

To edit a file, simply click on it to open the code editor.

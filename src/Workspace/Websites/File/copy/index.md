Copying a file creates a duplicate of the original file, which can then be edited or modified independently. This is useful for creating variations of content, backups, or templates. The copied file typically inherits the original's properties (such as format and metadata) but is considered a separate entity, allowing for unique edits or changes without impacting the original file.

## Copy a File

1. Select **"Copy"** from the menu. This will open a modal on the right side of the interface.

2. Choose the destination where you want to copy the selected file.

<p><img src="/static/images/files/copy.jpg" alt="Copy Modal" style="width: 37%;"></p>

3. You can update the file name by double-clicking on the file name.

4. Click <span class="text-blue">**Submit**</span>.

Make sure the item you want to copy is marked before submitting.

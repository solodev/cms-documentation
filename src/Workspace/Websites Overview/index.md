# Websites Overview

Solodev is a multi-site platform. You can run as many websites and apps with a single login and switch between websites easily. Each website has separate sources such as files and folders. When adding websites, each website will be installed from scratch with their own theme resources that can be shared across websites. There is also no FTP, hidden files, or need to log into the server.
